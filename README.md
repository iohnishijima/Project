# Welcome to My Web Portfolio Repository
## Introduction
Hello and thank you for visiting the repository of my web portfolio. This project is a personal showcase, designed to demonstrate my skills and projects in web development. The portfolio is crafted with a blend of modern technologies and frameworks, emphasizing my ability to create engaging, responsive, and high-performing web applications.

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
The frontend of the portfolio is built using JavaScript, with a heavy reliance on MUI (Material-UI) for the user interface components. MUI has been chosen for its versatility, ease of use, and the professional look it offers. It allows for the creation of a cohesive and visually appealing design that adapts well to different screen sizes, enhancing the user experience.

### Backend
On the backend, the application leverages Python and FastAPI. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. 

## Features
### Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on devices of all sizes.
